	<p>Frontend Application Developer</p>

	<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
	<p>
		Hello! My name is Landon (AKA Lando), and I'm a software developer who primarily
		focuses on application frontends. My expertise is in React (I know, I
		know), but I've also dabbled in other frameworks like Svelte and
		Eleventy. At work, I'm a senior engineer and a mentor, and I care a lot
		about best practices and elegant, maintainable code.
	</p>
	<p>
		I currently live in Virginia with my wife and our two cats. In my free
		time, I love video games, TTRPGs, board games, and the occasional
		programming personal project. Mostly I've been playing Old School
		RuneScape since my wife got me into it, and some of our recent board
		game favorites include Tokaido Duo, Wingspan, and Lovecraft Letters.
	</p>
	<p>
		As far as tech culture goes, I like hearing about new web dev news and
		internet technologies. However, a lot of my recent energy has gone into
		learning more about distributed social networking solutions and putting
		thought into how we can "scale down" our internet infrasctructure (to
		borrow @cwebber's words).
	</p>
	<p>
		To that end, I've been keeping up with <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cwebber@social.coop">Christine
			Lemmer-Webber's</a>
		long but fascinating blog posts as well as the work of the Spritely
		institute. I think they have a lot of really important thoughts on
		social network technologies and how we should move forward to ensure we
		maintain a healthy social space free from corporate interests.

			<h3>Personal Website</h3>
			<p>
				The website you're looking at! I created this site from scratch
				using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>, and I had a lot of fun
				doing it. I want this to be a central place for my thoughts, interests, and
				research that I can keep adding to over time.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you spend as much time online as I do, I think it's worth
				investing time into your online identity and connecting with others
				as best you can. I don't accomplish all of that all the time (I'm
				a lurker after)

			<h3>Check Your Balance</h3>
			<p>
				This was a passion project that serves as a quick and easy way to
				track Player Characters and Non-Player Characters in the tabletop
				roleplaying game <a href="https://magpiegames.com/pages/avatar-legends">Avatar Legends</a>,
				by Magpie Games. I used it myself
				for some of my games and was
				pleased with the results.
			</p>
			<p>
				The unstated goal of the project was to get some experience using a
				framework called <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>,
				which uses <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> to make
				performant and reactive web applications.
